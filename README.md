Habits, integral to our daily lives, constitute approximately 40-45% of our decisions, a mechanism evolved to conserve cognitive resources. These automatic behaviors are driven by a cue-craving-response-reward cycle, as seen in habits like smoking. Although essential, not all habits are advantageous. Recognising the significant role habits play in our routines is important, especially since many are formed unconsciously. Embracing positive habits and shedding negative ones, akin to compound interest, can lead to exponential improvements or declines in our well-being. The environment plays a pivotal role in habit formation, influencing both good and bad habits. By making positive habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying, and inverting this approach for negative habits, we can effectively shape our behaviors for better health and productivity.oductivity
